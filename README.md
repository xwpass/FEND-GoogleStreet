# FEND-googlestreet
This is a project that I worked for school purposes in *2015*.
By searching the place that you live, the webpage will show up the street view from **Googlestreet** api and the news that has happened around that area from **New York Times**, also, a wikipage shows the city information from  **wikipedia** api.
